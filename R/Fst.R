#Obtain Fst values for populations

#Function inputs: Using the package heirfstat. Input the population vcf file, a text file with samples and their population data, what column I what to be grouped to find the Fstat values between those populations
#Expected outputs: A table that gives the different populations as the row and columns and the Fst value is at the intersection between the two populations
