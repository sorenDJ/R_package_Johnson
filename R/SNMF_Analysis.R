#Run a population structure analysis using a sparse non-negative matrix factorization algorithm

#Expected inputs: Will be with the use of the LEA package. Input the population vcf file, range of K values to look at, the number of replicates
#Expected outputs: the estimate of number of ancestral populations, a structure bar plot to look at the admxiture of samples with the plot aranged by the ancetral populations
