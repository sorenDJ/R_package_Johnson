#Create a map of the samples that have admixture pie charts

#Expected inputs: csv or text file with the longitude and latitude of samples as well as population data, a .Q file from ADMIXTURE, size for the pie chart
#Expected outputs: a map with every sample as a pie chart of the admxiture. The samples that are from the same location should have a combined piechart that is a larger size based off the number of samples. I also want to have the ability for the sample name to be displayed on the map
